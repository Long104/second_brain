# sandbox

- A **sandbox** is a controlled and isolated environment where code can be executed without affecting the rest of the system.
  Itâ€™s designed to prevent potentially harmful or untrusted code from accessing sensitive resources like the file system, network,
  or other system components. The goal of a sandbox is to provide security by limiting what the code can do.
